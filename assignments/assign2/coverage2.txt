3. I found a two bugs: adventurer does not properly discard the cards it flips looking for a treasure, and feast had a while loop that had no exit condition if you chose a card you couldn't get (I had to fix that one because it would just loop forever and not actually finish the tests).
4. My tests cover 34.26% of the code with most branches tested in each function.  This means that there are a few branches of untested code in the functions there are unit tests for, a more robust test could probably get higher coverage of each function.  This also means that ~65% of the code is completely untested, never being run even once (which is not super great) and could have many other bugs.  This also does not guarantee that the functions tested are 100% bug free, the only things that are absolutely known to function are the exact cases I tested, every other case is still unknown.

I wasn't sure if I was supposed to fix the bugs I found or not.  I had to fix one so that the tests could finish and not just loop forever (original is commented), but I left the others.
